# MATLAB_Kauffman_NK_Random_Boolean_Network
The initial version of this is entirely thanks to the work of Christof Teuscher (http://www.teuscher.ch/christof/ext/), who created the original Matlab Random Boolean Network Toolbox, 2002-2007 (http://www.teuscher.ch/rbntoolbox/). Andrew Boysen (CSFive) made some changes, in order to be compatible with MatLab r2015a. Refer to the Toolbox site for additional overview and documentation information. This is posted with permission, under a BSD license, with permission from the original author. Additional updates (or notification of features that still don't work - I haven't tested all of them yet) are welcome.

This fork extends the above versions by implementing the Cascade Update scheme. See [Giacobini, M., Tomassini, M., De Los Rios, P., & Pestelacci, E. (2006). Dynamics of scalefree semi-synchronous Boolean networks. Artificial Life X, 1-7].

To install, copy the folder to the toolbox folder in your MATLAB/version file.
